<h1>My Future Plans!</h1>

    <p>My only real goal in life is to be comfortable and safe. I want to have an office job where I work on code all day. 
        I want to live in a nice house or even just an apartment, and have enough money to live comfortably while supporting myself and my parents.
    Computer Science has shown itself as one of the most important jobs in our society and I know I can get a good job if I embrace it. I also love technology anyways.</p>
    <p>I know the requirement is at least two paragraphs but this truly is all I want in life. I suppose a husband would be nice, but I wouldn't hate staying single either.</p>
